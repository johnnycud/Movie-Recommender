# Movie-Recommender
There is some functionality within the app but the cross functional with json API failed my to string tests
The structure of the classes were sound but the variables used in each class didn't create links in with the main Api created in the main
class.
Overall the User, Movie and Rating Classes were functional outside the ToString Json outputs, unfortunately the interface with
the data recovered from the Dat files may not have been inisilised properly in the corresponding methods, I'm not sure were the methods used were able to access the format inisialised . but most methods in the models seemed to run the proper functionality.
The links between the main method and the API's looked ok but the error was instanciated with the amount of variables
used in corresponding methods.
I was getting to link the correct inputs and outputs but I ran out of time.
